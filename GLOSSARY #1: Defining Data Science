Algorithms:	A set of step-by-step instructions to solve a problem or complete a task.	
Model:	A representation of the relationships and patterns found in data to make predictions or analyze complex systems retaining essential elements needed for analysis.
Outliers:	When a data point or points occur significantly outside of most of the other data in a data set, potentially indicating anomalies, errors, or unique phenomena that could impact statistical analysis or modeling.
Quantitative analysis:	A systematic approach using mathematical and statistical analysis is used to interpret numerical data.	Many Paths to Data Science
Structured data:	Data is organized and formatted into a predictable schema, usually related tables with rows and columns.	
Unstructured data:	Unorganized data that lacks a predefined data model or organization makes it harder to analyze using traditional methods. This data type often includes text, images, videos, and other content that doesnâ€™t fit neatly into rows and columns like structured data.
